    <h3>Details</h3>
       <p><code>msg.payload</code> is used to provide the payload of the text that should be displayed on the LCD display as well as how and where it 
        should be displayed. It consists of an array of JSON objects, each object representing a line on the display. The first object represents the first line, the 
        second represent the second line, and so on.</p>
        
       <p>Each object in the array can include any of the following keys :
           <ul>
               <li>"clear" - Set to <code>true</code> to clear the specific line before writing the text.</li>
               <li>"text" - Set to a string that should be written to the specific line on the display.</li>
               <li>"alignment" - Set to "center" for center alignment, or "right" for right alignment.</li>
           </ul>
        </p>

        <p>As an example, if you want to display a text string on line 1 that is center aligned and also clear the line first, and also display a text string on line 4 that is right aligned without clearing the line :</p>
<pre>"payload": [
    {
        "clear": true,
        "text": "Line 1 Text",
        "alignment": "center"
    },
    {},
    {},
    {
        "clear": false,
        "text": "Line 4 Text",
        "alignment": "right"
    }
]</pre>
        
        <p>Certain actions can be performed by specifying them in <code>msg.action</code>. Actions are performed prior to any messages being written to the display. 
            Available actions are:
        <ul>
            <li>"clearscreen" - To clear the entire screen.</li>
            <li>"on" - Turn the display on.</li>
            <li>"off" - Turn the display off.</li>
        </ul></p>
